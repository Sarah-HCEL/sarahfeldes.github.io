The Urban Belonging App is a central piece of the award-winning Urban Belonging project, studying diverse citizen perceptions of the city of Copenhagen. In collaboration with UseIT, developer Iain Kettles and the ECHO Lab, I helped to redesign the app in terms of UX and UI to make it accessible for people with special needs, assistive technologies and non-visual people. We started the process with a workshop on accessibility and a collective run-through of the app. After that we held workshops with the UseIT digital accessibility constulants, who taught us the critical features, tools and ways to assess digital tools and websites with regard to accessibility standards. From this we developed new wireframes, changed the UI and user flow, introduced an elaborate onboarding, added digital acccessibility features, and in collaboration with the developer of the app, developed a list of changes from editing HTML semantics to visual components such as color contrasting.
